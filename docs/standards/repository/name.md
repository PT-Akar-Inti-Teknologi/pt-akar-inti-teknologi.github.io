# Repository Name

## Why

From time to time, developers refer to an old project as a reference when working on a new and similar one, hence repositories should be easy to search by its name, clear and self-explanatory.

## Convention

- It should be all in lowercase
- It should be in snake case, using underscore (`_`). Correct: `ait_jira`. Wrong: `AIT-jira`
- The second part should be the known code name of the project. For example `vmall` for Virtual Mall, `hellogod` for Hello God application and so on. Again, this should be in sync with the client code in CRM used by other departments.
- The next part should be the domain specific part of the project. For example `backend` for Backend part, `frontend` for web application part, `mobile` for mobile app developed using hybrid framework such as Flutter or React Native, `android` and `ios` each for mobile app developed in native.
