# Branch Name

## Why

Git offers flexible branching strategies which are very useful for collaboration and CI/CD automation. However, using inconsistent naming conventions can lead to confusion and difficulty maintaining codebases.

> **Important:** No one is allowed to push directly to main branches like `main`, `staging`, `development`, or `production`. These branches can only be updated via **Pull Request**.

## Branch Types

There are two kinds of branches: **Regular Branches** and **Temporary Branches**.

---

## Regular Branches

These are permanent branches in the repository:

- `main`: The production branch. Always stable. No direct commits allowed. Changes must come from PRs from other branches such as `staging`.
- `staging`: Used for QA, UAT, and automation testing before changes are pushed to production.
- `development`: The default development branch where all code is integrated. Prefer PRs over direct commits.

Other permanent branches may be added (e.g., for specific environments or platforms). When doing so:

- Keep names short: `ubuntu20`, not `for-server-with-ubuntu-version-20`
- Use dashes `-` for separators
- Ensure it's truly permanentâ€”otherwise, use a temporary branch instead

## Temporary Branches

Created for specific tasks and removed after merging. Use the format:

```
<group>/<task-id>-description
```

### Group Prefixes

| Group      | Purpose                                                       |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | New features                                                  |
| `bugfix`   | Bug fixes or QA findings                                      |
| `hotfix`   | Urgent fixes for production                                   |
| `experiment` | Tryouts with new libraries, tools, or architectures         |
| `wip`      | Work-in-progress that may be incomplete or shared with others |

### Task ID

- Include task ID if available (e.g., JIRA ticket)
- Use dash `-` to separate multiple IDs
- Example: `feat/DEMO-1234-DEMO-4567-login`

### Description Rules

- Use **lowercase** only: `bugfix/login-error`, not `BugFix/LoginError`
- Be concise: `feat/operational-hours`, not `feat/implementing-store-operational-hours`
- Use **nouns**: `feat/ldap-integration`, not `feat/integrates-ldap`
- Use **dashes** `-` as word separators
